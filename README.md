### On the Generalization of Neural Combinatorial Optimization Heuristics

We provide the code for generic meta-training procedure to learn robust NCO heuristics, applicable to both reinforcement and supervised learning framework. 
Our code is based on the following repositories:
1. [Attention, Learn to Solve Routing Problems!](https://github.com/wouterkool/attention-learn-to-route) and
2. [An Efficient Graph Convolutional Network Technique for the Travelling Salesman Problem](https://github.com/chaitjo/graph-convnet-tsp)
